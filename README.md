# Ridge Regression — Understanding Key Concepts

-> This project explains the core intuition and key ideas behind **Ridge Regression**, a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in linear models.  
-> Instead of focusing on the implementation, this notebook highlights *why* Ridge works and *how* regularization affects the model.

## Key Concepts Covered:-
-> **L2 Regularization** and why the penalty term helps control model complexity  
-> **Effect on Weights** — how Ridge shrinks coefficients to prevent overfitting  
-> **Comparison with Linear Regression** on high-variance datasets  
-> **λ (Alpha) Tuning** and understanding how increasing Lambda changes the model  
-> **Bias–Variance Tradeoff** with regularization  
-> **Graphical Insights** to visualize coefficient shrinkage

## Objective:-
-> To build a strong conceptual understanding of Ridge Regression—beyond code—so you can confidently apply, explain, and tune this regularized model in real ML workflows.
